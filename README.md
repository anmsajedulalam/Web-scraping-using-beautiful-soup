# Web scraping using beautiful soup

Here I used beautiful soup for web scraping data from URLs. This code was focused on just two types of documents, they are : .pdf and .doc
Web scraped data was kept into 'contents' folder while scraping it. Later it was zipped as 'contents.zip', which contains four pdf documents which were fetched from the URL. The URL used here was from a website of BRAC University's Ayesha Abed Library's web page: http://library.bracu.ac.bd/downloads
